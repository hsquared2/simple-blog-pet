## Simple Blog/Article posting website

This pet project was created for educational purposes, to test knowledge and put it into practice.
The website's main functionality focuses on letting users read posts published by other users, and if authorized
being able to publish own posts on the website. The articles/posts are split into different categories.
Each article has a title, content and a category it belongs to. The users are also split into two different privilege categories
Only admin initially posesses higher privileges on the website, which gives him the ability to add new categories and delete
posts made by other users. Users can modify and delete articles if they are the original authors of the article. Users with higher privileges
also possess an ability to add new categories to the website. The project was written using procedural PHP, MySQL as a database and MVC architecture.
